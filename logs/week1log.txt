WEEK 1 LOG – Probing SOTA Models with Hard Examples

1.Research and study: 
 
Looked and reviewed below topics:
Kaiming He et al., “Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition” (ResNet, CVPR 2016).
Dosovitskiy et al., “An Image is Worth 16×16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale” (ViT, ICLR 2021).
Selvaraju et al., “Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-based Localization” (ICCV 2017).

Studied the concept of hard examples, how noisy samples affect model confidence and performance.

Understood the role of feature extraction, transfer learning, and model interpretability in probing SOTA models.
Reviewed the documentation and tutorials for the PyTorch and torchvision frameworks.
Understood the pytorch-grad-cam library for later visualization tasks.


2.Project Setup: 

Created a GitHub Repo "CAP6415_F25_project-Probing-SOTA-models-with-hard-examples"
Started work in Windows PowerShell
Checked Python version
Created and activated Python virtual environment
Installed dependencies like torchvision, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tqdm, pillow

3.Dataset Preparation:

 selected the CIFAR-10 dataset
 Used PyTorch’s built-in dataset loader with automatic download.
 
4.Model Implementation

Loaded pretrained ResNet-50 from Torchvision.
Used the model as a feature extractor.
Extracted 2048-dimensional feature vectors from all CIFAR-10 images.
Trained a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classifier on extracted features to serve as a non-trainable baseline.
Evaluated model on CIFAR-10 test set.
