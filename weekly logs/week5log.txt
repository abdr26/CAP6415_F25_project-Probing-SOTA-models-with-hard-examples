Week 5 Log – Project Demo Recording and Finalization

1. Prepared the project environment required for the demo:
    Verified that all scripts run correctly in sequence:
        train.py (Colab – T4 GPU)
        evaluate.py (local or Colab)
        hard_examples.py
        gradcam.py
    Confirmed that output folders (results/, models/, gradcam_outputs/) contain the
     expected artifacts for demonstration.

2. Re-ran the evaluation pipeline to ensure consistent outputs for the demo:
    Loaded the fine-tuned ResNet-50 checkpoint.
    Verified that accuracy, confusion matrix, and predictions CSV match previously saved results.
    Ensured misclassified.csv (406 samples) and low_confidence.csv (21 samples)
     remain reproducible.

3. Re-generated a small set of Grad-CAM visualizations:
    Selected representative examples from misclassified and low-confidence cases.
    Ensured the images for demo display clearly show attention heatmaps and failure modes.

4. Organized files and directories for a clean final demo:
    Checked README.md for clear instructions, images, and execution steps.
    Verified requirements.txt is complete and accurate.
    Ensured all paths in scripts are correct relative to the repository structure.

5. Scripted the content of the project demo video:
    Introduction: brief overview of the project goal and methodology.
    Training explanation: how ResNet-50 was fine-tuned on CIFAR-10 using Colab GPU.
    Evaluation: how the accuracy and confusion matrix were generated.
    Hard examples: what misclassified and low-confidence samples represent.
    Grad-CAM analysis: visual explanation of why certain mistakes happen.
    Conclusion: key insights learned and recommendations for improving model performance.

6. Recorded the project demonstration video:
    Showed the repository structure and explained the scripts.
    Demonstrated running evaluation, extracting hard examples, and generating Grad-CAM outputs.
    Displayed several Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight failure modes.
    Concluded with a summary of findings and potential improvements.

7. Saved the final demo video and double-checked audio, pacing, and clarity before submission.

Overall, Week 5 focused on verifying the reproducibility of the full pipeline, organizing results,
and producing the final video demonstration of the completed project.
