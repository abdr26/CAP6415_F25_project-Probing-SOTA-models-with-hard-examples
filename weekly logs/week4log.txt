WEEK 4 LOG 

1. Loaded all outputs from Week 3, including:
    misclassified.csv
    low_confidence.csv
    Grad-CAM visualizations for both categories.

2. Conducted failure analysis of the model:
    Identified attention drift issues.
    Found patterns of confusion between similar classes.
    Observed diffuse or weak activations in low-confidence samples.

3. Wrote detailed Week 4 analysis summarizing:
    Misclassification patterns
    Low-confidence sample behavior
    Interpretation of Grad-CAM heatmaps

4. Created final conclusion and improvement recommendations based on insights.

5. Prepared content for README.md including:
    Abstract
    Model architecture summary
    Data processing
    Hard example mining
    Grad-CAM visualizations
    Future work

6. Organized final project directory and verified all scripts:
    train.py
    evaluate.py
    hard_examples.py
    gradcam.py (with both CSVs)
    All notebooks and outputs

7. Downloaded Grad-CAM outputs locally and selected images for final report.
