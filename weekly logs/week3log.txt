WEEK 3 LOG — Hard Examples & Grad-CAM Visualization

1. Loaded the trained model checkpoint (resnet50_finetuned.pth) from Week 2.

2. Generated the full prediction CSV by running evaluate.py.
   This produced: test_predictions_finetuned.csv

3. Implemented hard_examples.py to extract:
    misclassified.csv (406 samples)
    low_confidence.csv (21 samples with conf < 0.40)

4. Verified both CSV files and ensured the "index" column was included.

5. Wrote and debugged gradcam.py:
    Loaded the CIFAR-10 test set
    Loaded the fine-tuned ResNet-50 model
    Applied Grad-CAM to misclassified samples
    Generated heatmap images for visual analysis

6. Created output folder gradcam_outputs/ and saved all visualization PNG files.

7. Downloaded all Grad-CAM images to local machine for report inclusion.

8. Performed qualitative analysis of the hardest examples using heatmaps.
   Observed attention drift, misfocused activations, and ambiguous features.

9. Prepared Week 3 report section summarizing misclassification patterns
   and Grad-CAM insights.

Overall, Week 3 successfully identified model weaknesses and produced 
visual explanations using Grad-CAM for inclusion in the final project deliverables.
